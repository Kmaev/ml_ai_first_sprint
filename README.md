This repository showcases my first hands-on exploration into Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI).

It contains a variety of early experiments ranging from classical ML algorithms — such as K-Means Clustering, Logistic Regression, 
Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), and Random Forests — to basic deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

Additionally, it includes early neural network tests integrated within Houdini.

These projects reflect an initial, practical investigation into model training, data preprocessing, and performance evaluation, 
built through iterative testing and experimentation across diverse datasets.
